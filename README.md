### Tests

Tests are separated between `unit` and `integration` tests, each with its own
subdirectory under the `tests` root directory. You will likely want to delete
the two example tests that are provided since they were included only for the
purpose of displaying the test structure and testing frameworks of choice,
`mocha` and `chai`. 

As expected, tests run with `npm test`.
